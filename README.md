                                                                                         Project Overview

This project predicts the price of bikes based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, engine, and more. It uses machine learning techniques to build a model that can estimate the selling price of a bike accurately.

Dataset -- The dataset contains information about different bikes, including specifications and prices.
Format: CSV
Features include: Brand, Model, Year, Engine, Mileage, etc.
Target: Price

Features--
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Encoding (e.g., OneHotEncoder for categorical data)
Model Training using Regression Techniques
Model Evaluation (RÂ² score, MAE, RMSE)

Technologies Used--
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn

How to Use --

1. Clone the repository:- git clone <your-repo-link>
2. Navigate to the project directory:- cd bike-price-prediction
3. Install required libraries:- pip install -r requirements.txt
